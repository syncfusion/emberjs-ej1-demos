        Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the representation of information from the
        user's interaction with it. The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view
        can be any output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same data are possible,
        such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The controller mediates input, converting
        it to commands for the model or view.The central ideas behind MVC are code reusability and n addition to dividing
        the application into three kinds of components, the MVC design defines the interactions between them.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>A controller </b>can send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the
                   model (e.g., by scrolling through a document). It can also send commands to the model to update the model's
                   state (e.g., editing a document).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>A model</b> notifies its associated views and controllers when there has been a change in its state.
                   This notification allows the views to produce updated output, and the controllers to change the available
                   set of commands. A passive implementation of MVC omits these notifications, because the application does
                   not require them or the software platform does not support them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>A view</b> requests from the model the information that it needs to generate an output representation
                   to the user.
            </li>
        </ul>
